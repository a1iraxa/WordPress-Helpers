#### Quoting

If you’re responding to a small part of a long comment, you can selectively quote out of the other
comment by preceding the lines with the > character. In fact, this is so common and so useful that
there is a keyboard shortcut for it. If you highlight text in a comment that you want to directly reply
to and hit the r key, it will quote that text in the comment box for you.

#### Emoji
Finally, you can also use emoji in your comments. This is actually used quite extensively in
comments you see on many GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. There is even an emoji helper in
GitHub. If you are typing a comment and you start with a : character, an autocompleter will help
you find what you’re looking for.

``
Emojis take the form of :<name>: anywhere in the comment. For instance, you could write
something like this:
``

I :eyes: that :bug: and I :cold_sweat:.
:trophy: for :microscope: it.
:+1: and :sparkles: on this :ship:, it's :fire::poop:!
:clap::tada::panda_face:

what you want to say can be found at:
